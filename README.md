# Credit-Score-Classification\

1)Analyzed credit-related information using statistical techniques to identify patterns and risk indicators.\
2)Engineered relevant features from financial and demographic data to enhance model accuracy.\
3)Built and trained a machine learning classification model to categorize credit scores as Good or Bad.\
4)Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\
5)Implemented data preprocessing pipelines to handle missing values and outliers, improving model robustness.
